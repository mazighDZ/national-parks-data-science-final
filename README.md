# National Parks Service Endangered Species Analysis

## üìÑ Project Overview

This data science project focuses on analysing data from the **National Parks Service** regarding endangered species across various parks in the United States.

The primary aim is to examine conservation statuses and explore potential patterns among species categories that are endangered. Through detailed analysis and visualisation, this project seeks to uncover meaningful insights that could inform conservation strategies.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Complete a comprehensive data science project suitable for a professional portfolio  
- Utilise **Jupyter Notebook** to document and communicate the analysis and findings  
- Conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis on a real-world dataset  
- Develop proficiency in the **end-to-end data analysis workflow**  
- Enhance skills in formulating questions, investigating data, and drawing evidence-based conclusions  

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

To fully engage with this project, it is recommended to have familiarity with:

- **Data Visualisation** tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Effective communication of data science insights and storytelling with data  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualisation  
- Git and GitHub for version control

## üí° Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   - Import and review the National Parks Service datasets on species and observations.  
   - Understand data structure, key variables, and summary statistics.  

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Address missing values and inconsistencies.  
   - Prepare the data for analysis through transformation and feature engineering.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Investigate conservation statuses across species categories.  
   - Use visualisations to reveal distributions and relationships within the data.  

4. **Hypothesis Formulation and Testing**  
   - Develop key hypotheses such as:  
     - Are certain species categories more prone to being endangered?  
     - Do particular parks exhibit higher proportions of endangered species?  
   - Analyse the data to support or refute these hypotheses with statistical evidence.  

5. **Insights and Conclusions**  
   - Summarise the primary findings and their implications.  
   - Reflect on how these insights could aid conservation efforts.  

6. **Communication of Results**  
   - Present the analysis comprehensively using Jupyter Notebook with clear visualisations and narrative.

## üìä Expected Outcomes

- Informative visualisations illustrating species conservation status by park and category  
- Identification of patterns or risk factors associated with endangered species  
- A well-documented, reproducible notebook demonstrating a professional data science workflow
