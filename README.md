# National Parks Service Endangered Species Analysis

## üìÑ Project Overview

This data science project focuses on analyzing data from the **National Parks Service** regarding endangered species across different parks in the United States.  

The main goal is to investigate conservation statuses and explore whether there are patterns or themes among the types of species that become endangered. By interpreting and visualizing this data, we aim to uncover meaningful insights to inform conservation efforts.

## üí° Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   - Load the National Parks Service dataset on endangered species.
   - Understand the data structure, columns, and basic statistics.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
   - Transform or encode necessary columns.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze the conservation statuses of species.
   - Visualize distributions and relationships.

4. **Hypothesis Generation and Testing**  
   - Pose questions such as:
     - Are certain categories of species more likely to be endangered?
     - Do specific parks have higher concentrations of endangered species?
   - Test hypotheses with data-driven approaches.

5. **Insights and Conclusions**  
   - Summarize key findings.
   - Discuss potential implications for conservation efforts.

6. **Communication of Results**  
   - Present findings clearly in Jupyter Notebook with visuals and narrative.

## üìä Expected Outcomes

- Clear visualizations illustrating species statuses across different parks.
- Identification of trends or risk patterns among different types of species.
- A reproducible notebook showcasing a professional data analysis workflow.
